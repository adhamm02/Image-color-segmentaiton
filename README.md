# Image-color-segmentaiton
This project is a desktop application built with Python that performs image color segmentation using K-Means clustering. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) created with tkinter, allowing users to import an image, specify the number of color clusters (k), and view both the original and segmented versions of the image.

The application processes the image by grouping pixels into k color clusters using the K-Means algorithm from scikit-learn. Each resulting cluster is displayed as a separate image where only the pixels belonging to that color group are shown. This enables users to visually analyze the dominant colors in an image.

The interface is user-friendly, with smooth scrolling, styled widgets, and dynamic display updates, making it a practical tool for basic image analysis and color-based segmentation tasks.
